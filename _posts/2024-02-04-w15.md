## WEEK 15
Week 15 is Week 4 of the W24 term.

### Electrical Progress Updates
Exciting week for electrical engineering! The oscillators ordered last week arrived. We attached the ASEMB-8 oscillator to the ultrasonic circuit which allowed us to drive the transducers at their resonant frequency. This means that we were able gather water level data. The next steps are to obtain water flow data by changing the physical and firmware configrations of the ultrasonic system.

Electrical (technically firmware) also pushed working ultrasonic driver code! This is the code for the TDC1000 chip that enables us to get measurements from the chip to the MCU. 

### Mechanical Progress Updates
Mechanical started preliminary design on the waterproof encasing. We brainstormed potential solutions and are currently looking into mini aluminum extrusion for framing with transparent walls out of lexan.

Mechanical's next steps also include making ultrasonic sensor attachement and relevant researches about ultrasonic paste. 

### Software Progress Updates
Software has minimal updates -- it appears that the database schema will need to be modified moving forward, and the bluetooth communication setup for the app should be in a working state (theoretically). Software is planning on shifting this functionality to the back-burner due to complications in testing it and instead focusing on the WiFi enabling and database communication that will occur on an ESP32-S3 based board.
