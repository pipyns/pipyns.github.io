## WEEK 16
Week 16 is Week 5 of the W24 term.

### Electrical/Firmware Progress Updates
One point of success is the WiFi connectivity of the embedded system! The ESP32-S3 board has proven itself able to connect to WiFi, and we are currently exploring accessing Firestore. There is a myriad of resources available for this task, so we know it's possible! It's just a matter of implementing it. Electrical has also largely been focused on the ToF chip, including the acquisition of a few new parts to allow for seamless communication between the MCU and its peripherals.  

### Mechanical Progress Updates
Mechanical has created V1 of the enclosure design! It looks very nice and is intended to couple to the original steel plate for mounting. We will review the design as a team and provide feedback to hopefully achieve the best design possible!

Jake had COVID this week and is feeling very tired :(  
Here is a song that he enjoyed while resting:
