## WEEK 21

Week 22 is Week 11 of the W24 term. 

### Team Progress Update
This is the last week! Symposium is coming up real hot next Monday, so a lot of things happened. 

For our mechanical system, we iterated over several mount designs. We tried thinner pipes, copper mounts, full PLA intrusive solutions, and PLA mounts with or without PLA plastic directly under the transducers. At the end, we were successfully able to create an intrusive PLA solution that can attach to pipes and help us monitor water flow.

In the mean time, we did not give up on our non intrusive solution. We realized that copper attenutated ultrasound too much and a possible solution was to step up on the input voltage. Using the parts purchased last week, we implemented a level shifter that successfully upped the tx signal to 11 volts. Unfortunately, this was still not enough. We are still optimistic about this solution, but unfortunately, we were limited by the amount of time we had. This will have to be a future step. 

Software at the same also saw incredible progress. Software updates is flushing out visualization of data and burst detection and UI stuff for burst response + manual control. This marked the end of app development as we completed a working version. We have also implemented wireless control on the system.
