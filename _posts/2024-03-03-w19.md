## WEEK 19

Week 19 is Week 8 the W24 term. 

### Team Progress Update
Lots of exciting things happened this week! We reached a big milestone where the electrical work for the ultrasonic sensors have concluded! 

### Electrical Updates
The PCBs for both the ultrasonic and power boards have arrived! The components we ordered for the boards have also arrived. We populated the boards and baked them in the reflow oven. 
The ultrasonic PCB, which at this point got shortened to uPCB, was electrically verified. This means the electrical side of the ultrasonic sensors is done. 
The power PCB still requires two very specific resistors that we will obtain very soon. Fortunately, the uPCB is much more important at the moment and this board's bring up was successful.

### Firmware Updates 
Lots of work went into firmware this week. We were able to merge the TDC1000 and TDC7200 code into one file so that the main MCU can talk to both ICs on SPI. For context, these are crucial ICs needed for the uPCB. 
Firmware was also able to confirm the functionalities of the uPCB by uploading code that we know works. This means we can retire the breadboard setup for the ultrasonic sensors and move to a much clearner PCB version. 

### Software Updates 
To get the training data for our ML model, we completed the first model on Matlab for the simulation. 
On the other hand, the database schema was reworked. 

### Mechanical Updates 
We received enclosure parts from McMaster Carr. 
Made design adjustments for the motor mount bracket based on manufacturing restrictions of E5 student machine shop. 

### Jake's Weekly Updates
"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
