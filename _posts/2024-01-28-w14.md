### Jake's Weekly Updates

### Team Progress Update

For this weeks's updates, software is currently developing the Bluetooth features. The app can now poll Bluetooth devices in its vicinity and connect with the correct one based on the device ID! This is ideally the mechanism by which we will be able to setup/configure a fresh installation of our device into a home. 

Electrical borrowed an oscilloscope from MESS and was able to get a signal on the rx path (even if it's just capacitive interference). Electrical also realized that the ultrasonic driver chip TDC100 was only being driven with 80khz when a minimum of 2mhz is needed. A new 8mhz oscillator was purchased and is pending delivery.

Mechanical purchased a new 80KG*cm motor, 3D-printed the 3rd generation of motor-to-handle attachment, and successfully tested that the new motor is capable of pulling the valve handle for the full 90deg rotation! After this, Mechanical just needs to design some mounting mechanism for the full system to attach to the pipe as well as to house the electronics!

Go Team!
