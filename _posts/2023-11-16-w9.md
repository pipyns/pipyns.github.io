## WEEK 9: 
Week 9 is meant to be a wrap up week before the course ends with Final Design Presentations.
The slides are due Monday, Nov. 20th by noon, so the team is making efforts to solidify the design decisions.

While the team is extremely stretched over the excess of deliverables, here are the approximate goals for this week:
- Mechanical will be aiming to CAD the sensor attachments to the pipe and investigate sealability of the water-sensitive elements.
- Software will be setting up the database and design the software outline for the project.
- Electrical intentends to run sensor tests using an oscilloscope in one of the University labs.

### Meeting with Professors
