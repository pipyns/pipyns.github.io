## WEEK 20

Week 20 is Week 9 the W24 term. 

### Team Progress Update
GREAT SUCCESS! The team has managed to fully test and validate that uPCB and pPCB that will be used in our final demonstration -- and with little time to spare! We have succeeded in acquiring both unidirectional and bidirectional readings from the ultrasonic transducers and are actively working on pulling everything together for the upcoming prof meeting.

### Electrical Updates
The last few components of the pPCB were acquired and installed over the course of the last week, and we validated that the pPCB was successfully regulating both power rails. Some hiccups occured when one of the transducers experienced a wire shearing and needed to be re-crimped; however, we're back on track and looking to continue our testing!

### Firmware Updates 
Firmware succeeded in getting bidirectional sensor readings from the uPCB! With the devolpment of an intermediary interface between the ICs and the ESP32, we made it much less difficult to obtain readings from the ICs. Firmware is actively working on sensor testing in conjunction with mechanical and electrical. Due to the complexities of integrating database and other communications, it is likely that this will be done after the upcoming prof meeting.

### Software Updates 
Software generated multiple simulations of plumbing use (including a burst scenario), added noise based on expected sensor signal strength, and began working with ML to develop an efficient, light-weight binary classifier.

### Mechanical Updates 
Mechanical has assembled the skeleton of the enclosure! Everything fits well together, and despite some small problems with the McMaster Carr parts (non-tapped mounting plates), it looks good.

### Jake's Weekly Updates
SYDE is my favorite department because they have the most reasonably-constructed courses and the most organized professors.
