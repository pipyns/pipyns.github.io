## WEEK 13
Week 13 is Week 2 of the W24 term.

### Meeting with Professors
This week the first Meeting with advisors has taken place.
Professor Kennings is replacing prof. Thistle for the remainder of the Capstone project, and prof. Khamesee is staying on the supervising team.

Unlike MTE 481, this course (MTE 482) will not have this section as a weekly update. There are a total of 3 Meetings with the professors.
The first two are building and implementation updates, and the 3rd is meant to demonstrate a working prototype.
