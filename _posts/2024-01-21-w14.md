### Jake's Weekly Updates

### Team Progress Update

For this weeks's updates, software is currently developing the Bluetooth features. The app can now poll Bluetooth devices in its vicinity and connect with the correct one. 

Electrical borrowed an oscilloscope from MESS and was able to get a signal on the rx path even if its just capacitive interference. Electrical also realized that the ultrasonic driver chip TDC100 was only being driven with 80khz when a minimum of 2mhz is needed. A new 8mhz oscillator was purchased and pending delivery.

Mechanical puchsed the motor, 3D-printed the 3rd generation of motor-to-handle attachment, and successfully tested that the new motor is capable of pulling the valve handle for the full 90deg rotation!


Go Team!
