## WEEK 13
Week 13 is Week 2 of the W24 term.

### Meeting with Professors
This week the first Meeting with advisors has taken place.
Professor Kennings is replacing prof. Thistle for the remainder of the Capstone project, and prof. Khamesee is staying on the supervising team.

Unlike MTE 481, this course (MTE 482) will not have this section as a weekly update. There are a total of 3 Meetings with the professors.
The first two are building and implementation updates, and the 3rd is meant to demonstrate a working prototype.

### Jake's Weekly Updates 
my goal for tomorrow is to wake up

### Team Progress Update

The group had its regular meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 17th.

Following a significant drop in temperature, the team has moved from testing outdoors to indoors.
Based on this decision, Mechanical has purchased the necessary connectors to interface the pipe section with a shower hose.
This included a copper FNPT-to-solder fitting, and a pipe nipple (double MNPT connection).

The finished testing setup:

The copper fitting was soldered following this compatibility test.

Additionally, the current motor selection was tested to determine whether it was capable of meeting the torque requirements to turn the valve handle.
This test was done in collaboration between Mechanical and Electrical.

Two motor-to-handle connectors were 3D-printed to interface the motor with the valve, one of them is pictured below.

Unfortunately, the main motor was not functional, and the backup motor was not powerful enough without an additional gearbox.
Following the unsuccessful tests, it was decided to research and procure a hobby servo motor (the previous motor selection was equipment obtained from the MESS maker space).

Software & Firmware have no significant updates to report.


They call it Dimi's pipe but really it belongs to everyone on this team just as much.
