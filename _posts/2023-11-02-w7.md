## WEEK 7

For this week, we focused on determining the tech stack and developing a clearer picture for our software flow/implementation. While our PDP laid out our initial plan, this project warrants a more thorough examination of the technologies available to us. Test best components were also purchased, including a length of 0.75" ID copper pipe and a quarter-turn ball valve.

### Meeting with Professors
This week's meeting was simply a check-in to update the professors on our progress. We mainly discussed the software flow as well as plans for our next steps. The professors' feedback mainly pertained to how our team should perform more mathematical and theoretical analysis for our official design deliberable. This includes signal filtering calculations, torque approximations, FEA simulations of the mechanical system, etc.

### Going Forward
For next week, we will be focusing more on analytical calculations including torque, potential filters if necessary, as well as ultrasonic detection distance. Additionally, we aim to pick our motor for next week as well as complete our database setup and determining our function inputs/outputs.

Remember, a burst projected into higher dimensional space is just a burst in lower dimensional space. Keep spacing, everyone!
