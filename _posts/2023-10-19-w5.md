## WEEK 5: Preliminary Design Presentation - Preparation
<!--summary statement-->
The deliveverable for Week 5 is the Preliminary Design Presentation slides, so we were compiling the necessary information.

### Content Expectations

UW LEARN announcement states the following:

- Need
- Goal and Objectives
- Specifications
- Constraints and Criteria
- Alternate Design Solutions
- Patent Search (at least 3 patents) â€“ Relative merits and demerits
- Is your design Patentable?
- Design Selection Matrix
- Project Timeline

The first 5 points were gradually addressed in the previous weeks' deliverables, and the team only needed to refine the initial drafts based on the feedback provided during advisor meetings.
Specifications were mistakenly put on the list by the teaching team and were scrapped from it upon a clarification.

Patent Search had to be done specifically for this deliverable, and was pretty helpful to gauge the extents to which the field has been blocked for further innovation.
The area of burst detection and prevention has been thoroughly patented and our design uses several methods that intersect the protected applications, so it was deemed not patentable.

Design Selection Matrix has also been slightly revised based on the updated Criteria, and is presented in the table below.

| Criteria             | Design 1  | Design 2   |Design 3    |
| :----:               |  :----:   |   :----:   | :----:     |
|    Cost              |     3     |      2     |      1     |
|  Footprint           |     3     |      2     |      2     |
| Sensor Effectiveness |     2     |      3     |      1     |
|  Invasiveness        |     3     |      1     |      3     |
|   Ease of Use        |     3     |      2     |      1     |
|  Power Redundancy    |     2     |      0     |      1     |
|  Danger              |     3     |      2     |      3     |
|  **Total Score**     |     19    |      12    |      12    |

Design 1 is now chosen to be prioritized for testing.

An approximate project timeline was also created for the sake of PDP, with each project Stage now being more concrete.

### Professor Feedback

No meeting with the advisors was held this week, hence no feedback was provided.
