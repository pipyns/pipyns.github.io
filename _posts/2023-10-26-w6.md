## WEEK 6: Preliminary Design Presentation 

This week we presented our progress to the cohort and our supervising professors as well as discussed the creation of the test bed. 

### The Presentation 
We presented the slideshow we put together over week 5. 

This included: 
- Our need statement
- Goals and objectives 
- Criteria
- Constraints
- Design ideas and the decision matrix
- Patent research
- Preliminary design blocks
- Next steps

### Tasks for next week - test bed 
At the end of the week, we worked together to solidify our test bed for the first prototype. The main goal of this test bed is to simply ensure the ultrasonic sensors are able to read water velocity. We want to keep this as simple as possible because we are still unsure about the functionalities of the ultrasonic sensors, and therefore it doesn’t make sense to heavily invest into the test bed at the moment. 

With testing the sensors as the only goal in mind, the requirements are fairly simple. The creation of this test bed will be part of our to-do list for next week. We will look for a 3/4” pipe that is connected to a valve. 


### Supervising Professor Change 
During week 6, we were also informed that our supervising professor James Tung will be leaving cap stone. In his place, professor Behrad Khamesee will be joining us.
