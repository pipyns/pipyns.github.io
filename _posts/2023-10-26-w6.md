## WEEK 6 

This week we presented our progress to the cohort and our supervising professors, as well as discussed the creation of the test bed. 

### The Presentation 
We presented the slideshow we put together over week 5 -- a summary of its contents can be found [here](). 

This included: 
- Our Need/Problem Statement
- Goals and Objectives 
- Criteria
- Constraints
- Design Ideas and Decision Matrix
- Patent Research
- Preliminary Design Sketches and Diagrams
- Next Steps

### Tasks For Next Week - Test Bed Development
At the end of the week, we worked together to solidify our test bed for the first prototype. The main goal of this test bed is to simply ensure the ultrasonic sensors are able to read water velocity. We want to keep this as simple as possible because we are still unsure about the functionalities of the ultrasonic sensors, sp it doesn’t make sense to heavily invest into the test bed at the moment. 

With testing the sensors as the only goal in mind, the requirements are fairly simple. The creation of this test bed will be part of our to-do list for next week. We will look for a 3/4” pipe that is connected to a valve. 

### Supervising Professor Change 
During week 6, we were also informed that one of our advising professors, James Tung, will be taking an absence from the remainder of MTE481. In his place, professor Behrad Khamesee will be joining us. We're looking forward to seeing what Dr. Kamesee has to say!

Bursting, bursting never changes. Stay safe out there!
