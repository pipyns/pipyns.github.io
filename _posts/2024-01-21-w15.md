## WEEK 14
Week 15 is Week 5 of the W24 term.

### Electrical Progress Updates
Exciting week for electrical engineering! The oscillators ordered last week arrived. We attached the ASEMB-8 oscillator to the ultrasonic circuit which allowed us to drive the transducers at their resonant frequency. This means that we were able gather water level data. The next steps are to obtain water flow data by changing the physical and firmware configrations of the ultrasonic system.

Electrical (technically firmware) also pushed working ultrasonic driver code! This is the code for the TDC1000 chip. 

### Mechanical Progress Updates
Mechanical started preliminary design on the waterproof encasing. We brainstormed potential solutions and are currently looking into mini aluminum extrusion for frame with transparent walls out of lexan.

Mechanical's next steps also include making ultrasonic sensor attachement and relevant researches about ultrasonic paste.
