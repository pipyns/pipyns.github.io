Welcome to our Capstone Project Website! We are **Pipyns**!

According to [Ruby Home Real-Estate](https://www.rubyhome.com/blog/water-damage-stats/), the average cost for a water damage claim is almost $12,000 USD, and nearly 2% of all homes (in the US) experience water damage. From a non-fiscal perspective, pipe bursts also cause a disasterous loss of sentimental items, as the water damage can contaminate or otherwise destroy them.

Our goal is to provide home-owners with a device that can detect and respond to pipe bursts by shutting off water at the post-meter control valve. This will result in a reduction in the amount of time a pipe could burst without home-owners knowing as well as a means by which damage can be effectively mitigated. Since the post-meter control valve is the main water supply for a home, this provides a key point at which we can take action, though importantly, access to it cannot be obstructed. Additionally, it is not desirable for a user to cut into their plumbing system in order to install a monitor. Most existing solutions require this sort of approach, where the system must be installed in-line with the plumbing system.

## Anticipated Design Features

- Non-Invasive Sensors and Non-Obstructive Actuator Installation
- Robust Electronics to Facilitate Accurate Sensing and Communication
- Advanced ML/AI Burst Detection Algorithms that Adapt to Users' Behaviours
- User Application Interface to Enable Real-Time Monitoring and Control
- Customizability to Users' Varying Needs
